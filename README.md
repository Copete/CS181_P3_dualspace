Note about handout code: we have provided it to help you, but feel free to 
follow a different approach. See `practical-3.pdf` for more info.

You can find the test data in the Files section of the [CS181 Canvas page](https://canvas.harvard.edu/courses/37343/files). The training data was a little too large for Canvas, so you can find the training data at this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-OUW6C1AdIlllJKUJ_bcb4JarGQfd_fr/view?usp=sharing).
